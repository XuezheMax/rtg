# Yet Another NMT

Yet Another Neural Machine Translation toolkit based on pytorch.
At least this one hopes to keep code simple and readable.


### Features :
 + RNN based Encoder-Decoder with Attention
 + Easy and interpretable (throw the magics out of this box)



### TODO :
 + Byte Pair Encoding
 + "Attention is all you need"
